Devices register automatically when you:

1. Log in on the device
2. Start playing music
3. The device appears in your device list

### Device Names

Devices are named automatically based on:

- Browser and OS (e.g., "Chrome on MacBook")
- Device type (Web, Mobile, Desktop)

2. Click the edit icon next to a device
3. Enter a custom name

## Queue Synchronization

### Sync Queue

Keep all devices on the same queue:

1. Open the queue panel
2. Click **Sync to all devices**
3. All devices receive the queue

### Per-Device Queues

By default, each device has its own queue. Sync only when you want to share.

## Common Scenarios

### Start at Home, Continue Mobile

1. Build a queue on your computer
2. Click device picker
3. Select your phone
4. Playback continues on your phone

### Party Mode

1. Connect a device to speakers
2. Control from your phone
3. Let guests request songs via their phones

### Multi-Room Audio

1. Register devices in different rooms
2. Transfer playback as you move
3. Or sync for simultaneous playback

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Appearing

1. Ensure you're logged into the same account
2. Refresh the page on the missing device
3. Check network connectivity

### Playback Won't Transfer

1. Verify the target device is online
2. Check that playback isn't blocked (muted tab, etc.)
3. Refresh both devices

### Controls Unresponsive

1. Check internet connection
2. Wait a few seconds for sync
3. Refresh the controlling device

### Delay in Updates

Some delay is normal:

- Local changes: instant
- Remote changes: 100-500ms typical
- Poor connection: 1-2 seconds

## Removing Devices

### Unregister a Device

1. Open device picker
2. Click the X next to the device
3. Confirm removal

### Automatic Cleanup

Devices inactive for 30+ days are automatically removed.

## Privacy & Security

### Device Visibility

Only you can see and control your devices. Other users cannot:

- See your device list
- Control your playback
- Access your queue

### Session Security

Each device has its own authentication token. Logging out on one device doesn't affect others.

## Mobile Considerations

### Background Playback

On mobile devices:

- Keep the browser tab active for remote control
- iOS may pause audio when backgrounded
- Android supports background playback

### Battery Usage

Remote control uses minimal battery when idle. Active streaming uses normal audio battery.
